## 💼 Experience

### Software Development Intern, **Quadeye** (Gurugram)  
_Dec 2024 – Present_  
- Built a low-latency futures & options trading platform using **Apache Kafka** and **WebSocket** streams. Processed **15 000+** market events/sec across 6 000+ instruments, achieving **median 8 ms latency** for live updates and **5 ms** for order placement, with **99.9%** uptime.  
- Deployed an internal notification and messaging tool (with **Markdown** support), improving cross-team alert visibility by 60%, reducing Slack-based alerts by 40%, and cutting developer context-switch time by ~25%.  
- Developed a manual crypto-fund transfer feature: logged ~300 daily transactions to **MongoDB** (sub 30 ms write latency) and executed each transfer under 500 ms—boosting throughput and auditability.  
- Implemented an interactive **D3.js** graph visualizing 50+ strategy releases and dependencies; parallelized CI/CD workflows to reduce pipeline time by 75%, and optimized **MySQL** queries for 110% faster average response times.  
- Built and deployed full-stack web solutions using **Django** (Python) for backend APIs and **React** for frontend, integrating **Celery**, **Cronjobs**, **Redis**, **AWS**, and **HTC** for scalable background processing and storage.
